# FeTaQA: Free-form Table Question Answering

FeTaQA is a **F**r**e**e-form **Ta**ble **Q**uestion **A**nswering dataset with 10K Wikipedia-based {*table, question, free-form answer, supporting table cells*} pairs. It yields a more challenging table QA setting because it requires generating free-form text answers after retrieval, inference, and integration of multiple discontinuous facts from a structured knowledge source. Unlike datasets of generative QA over text in which answers are prevalent with copies of short text spans from the source, answers in our dataset are human-generated explanations involving entities and their high-level relations.
